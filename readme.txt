== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why don't the pre-installed code snippets work? =

Every code snippet needs to use WordPress' Hook actions and filters, but if the hook is not within your theme, these snippets will have no place to attach to.

= What themes will the default snippets work for? =

They will generally work for any modern, up-to-date theme. The custom header logo requires the "theme_header" hook to remove the title and description.

= What is required to create my own code snippet =

Your code will need to be in a PHP functions and placed in the correct location by 'add_action()' or 'add_filter()'. It is recommended that you fill in the default header, which is in a multi-line comment, but it can be done automatically for you. 

= Will my Wordpress break if I write code with errors? =

This plugin will automatically turn off any code snippet if it causes a fatal error, but not necessarily if it has an error or typo. Then on the second page load, that code snippet that failed will not be included and the 'Theme Options Panel' will highlight the failed code snippet.

= How can I insert image addresses into text boxes without copying and pasting the image address? =

By activating the Image Management snippet and using it to manage your images, you can do away with messing with URLs. Option pages that have thickbox running and have `<?php do_action('image_url_input', 'THE_TEXTBOX_NAME'); ?>` after each textbox that deals with images, will for those form fields have an image icon that allows you to select an image visually. 

== Screenshots ==

1. The Theme Options Plugin manages code, unlike other methods in which unrelated code gets mixed together.
2. Code snippets can be edited throught the backend and are saved in the database, rather than in a file.
